                        <b>In May 2015, my husband and I stayed at a very unique hotel in Kawazu, Japan. The hotel, 
                           "Gallery Court Ofa Atu," is a family business owned by the Kashiwamura family. It is not just a hotel, but 
                            also a gallery that displays many paintings by the owner's parents. We didn't expect the dinner to be very good
                            because it is located in the middle of nowhere. However, the dinner was surprisingly delicious. Everything was home-made, and 
                            the freshly baked bread was delicious. My favoriate is the assorted sashimi (raw fish) that includes lobster and abalone. My husband
                            is really picky about food, but even he said this chef is really good and he could be very successful if he opens up a restaurant in Tokyo.                               </b>

                           They sell okonomiyaki, chow mein (stir-fried noodles), and more. Okonomiyaki is basically a pancake with variety of toppings, such as
                           meat, seafood, cabbage, green onion, etc. You can also have okonomiyaki with chow mein, so the best option for two
                           is to order one regular okonomiyaki, and one with chow mein. You can grill your own okonomiyaki, but you can also ask
                           the waitress to help as well. Honestly speaking, okonomiyaki is easy to make and the okonomiyaki at this restaurant wasn't amazing.                            </b>

                        <b> You might heard of Tsukiji market, but you might not associate it with soba. Tsukiji Sarashinanosato is a restaurant that
                            specializes in soba, or buckwheat noodle. Soba noodles are served either in hot broth as a noodle soup, or chilled with a dipping sauce. 
                            Even though it is next to the fish market, it was still packed when we came. The soba here were chewy with grainy texture, and the dipping 
                            sauce is a bit on the salty side. Therefore, I suggest just dip the noodles lightly, so the delicate taste of soba isn't overwhelmed by the dipping sauce.

                            is sauceless with lots of herbs such as cilantro, green onion, and parsley. The taste of their "curry" is very similar to fried rice, and I thought
                            the ground meat on top of the rice balances perfectly with the herbs. I'd say it's a must-try if you are going to Kamakura, but just be aware that the line
                            may be line since the restaurant is quite popular.                             </b>
